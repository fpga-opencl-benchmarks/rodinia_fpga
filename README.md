# Rodinia Benchmark Suite for OpenCL-based FPGAs

The Rodinia Benchmark Suite is a set of benchmarks originally developed at University of Virginia. See `README_original` for the original description, or visit [here](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~skadron/wiki/rodinia/index.php) for more details.

The Rodinia Benchmark Suite for OpenCL-based FPGAs is our modified version of the original benchmarks for FPGAs using Intel FPGA SDK for OpenCL. Xilinx FPGAs are NOT supported. The following benchmarks are ported to Intel FPGAs:

- nw (full optimization)
- hotspot (full optimization)
- hotspot 3D (full optimization)
- pathfinder (full optimization)
- srad (full optimization)
- lud (full optimization)
- cfd
- bfs
- b+tree
- backprop
- lavaMD

Each modified benchmark is available under [the opencl directory](opencl). See [the original README file](README_original) for more details about each benchmark. Each FPGA version has a readme included that describes the parameters and optimizations for that version.

The input data files for the benchmarks are not included in this distribution and need to be separately downloaded from [here](http://lava.cs.virginia.edu/Rodinia/download.htm).

## Important note

Makefiles are NOT guaranteed to work correctly for kernel compilation and should only be used for compiling the host codes using the HOST_ONLY=1 flag. Compile kernels manually with the settings reported in Hamid's PhD thesis.
